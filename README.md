The snake game is a very popular, simplistic, and addictive video game around the globe launched in 1997 with Nokia 6110. It is based on the concept where the player manoeuvres a line (snake) which grows in length every time the line eats more dots ‘egg’, with the line itself being a primary obstacle as it would die if it collided into itself. As a result, the growth of its length makes the game even more difficult and challenging to play further on. 

This project aims to explore a new dimension in the traditional snake game to make it more interesting and challenging. The simplicity and the fun element of the game makes it an ideal minor project in C language as we can focus on advanced concepts like multiplayer functionality and dot matrix using which the snake and egg will be displayed. Moreover, switches will be used for start and stop of the game and for snake movements left, right, up, and down.
